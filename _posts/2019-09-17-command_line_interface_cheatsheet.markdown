Abbreviation
* **CLI**: Command Line Interface
*  **GUI**: Graphical User Interface

These two type of interfaces allow the user to use the complete functionalities of a computer, by using a **SHELL** program. The SHELL is a program started by the terminal (CLI or GUI) and which will prompt the user for input and return the output. Bash is the shell used by Unix systems (in Mac OS and Linux).
